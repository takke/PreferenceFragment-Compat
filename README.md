Support PreferenceFragment
=====================================

Unofficial PreferenceFragment compatibility layer for Android 1.6 and up.

###About the status of the library
This project is not abandoned, i just haven't had time to spare for it; I accept pull-requests and all the good Github open-source stuff though. 

It is in my plans to actually give it the holo love it deserves [soon](http://www.wowwiki.com/Soon) (tm).

How to use it?
===================================

Just extend PreferenceFragment and follow the Settings developer guide like if this layer wasn't even there to begin with.

Roadmap
==================================
- Bump the presentation of the settings on Gingerbread and lower with some Holo love
- Include a handful of useful extra preferences
